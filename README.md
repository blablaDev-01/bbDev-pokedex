  user flow is simple - the user opens the app and has a list of pokémons. they can examine details of every pokémon. they can put certain pokémon into a favorites list. these need to be present after a reload! they also have a types tab, where pokémons are sorted by type.

## blablaDev concept

![dev path](https://blabladev.com/wp-content/uploads/blablaDev-developers-flowchart.png)

#### a picture is worth a thousand words

you pick a project and work on it as you normally would. when you're done, you make a PR and we'll examine your code and give you a review. **we'll review your project 3 times**, so make sure those PRs count. after that, you can (and should) still work on your project and improve it, after all this is your CV :grinning:

after every PR you get a certain score _(you can check those in our app)_ and you go on our ranking list. companies lurk among this list and look for promising developers to hire, make sure you impress them!
